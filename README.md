# YumYum Fresh API Documentation

Yum Yum Fresh's goal is to bring seasonal and local produce information into the hands of the user. Due to the lack multiple disparate sources of information we had to aggregate, compile, new data sets to a relational and queryable API. 

This information is still incomplete and should only be used as faker data.
